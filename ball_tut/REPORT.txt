Ball Tutorial

Project Overview
The goal of this tutorial was to learn how to set goals for animation, how to do squash and stretch, seeing up a hierarchy to separate transformations, how to adjust animation curves 

Artist Goals
Visually the goal was to make a pretty goopy ball that squashed and and stretched on impact. We also wanted to eliminate weirdness like the ball rolling on the bounce or sliding when it should be rolling.

Challenges

I struggled with differentiating between the rotate node and the transform/scale node, at first I put everything on the rotate node. 

I was confused about how we were able to set different pivots for a group and things within that group. 

Also, I struggled with the one step in the tutorial about not creating an ease in/out on the acceleration/deceleration. However, I think I figured it out? Not sure because I had to put the two inside points pretty close to the corners so that the point of impact would be "flat" ie there wouldn't be any forward motion.
